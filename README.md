# Simple project

* `ansible` - TBD, plans to add various ansible roles
* `docker-compose` - simple networking
* `docker` - images for quick testing scripts, tools, etc.
* `jenkins` - pipeline template/practice. ~~the most interesting here~~
* `python` - python scripts
* `vagrant` - if needed some VM's for ansible tasks
